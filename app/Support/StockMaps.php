/**
 * The maps that come with Quake III Arena itself.
 *
 * Read off the .bsp files in pak0 through pak8 of a stock install - pak0 holds
 * the game's own maps, pak2 adds q3tourney6_ctf, and pak6 the four pro- recuts
 * from the 1.32 point release. Fixed since 2001, so a list rather than
 * something to detect at runtime.
 *
 * These have no pk3 of their own to offer: Worldspawn describes them as
 * "Quake III: Arena.pk3" at the size of the whole game, which says where the
 * map comes from rather than naming a file anyone can download. Telling them
 * apart from a map that is simply lost matters, because the two deserve very
 * different things said about them.
